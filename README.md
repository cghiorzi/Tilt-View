# Tilt-View

Tilt-View is a set of Visualizations to be used with [Kurt Telep's TiLT](https://github.com/ktelep/tilt) application. They are designed to help show how data and algorithms can be incorporated into business processes to aid in decision making.

The following Visualizations are available:

* Pitch - This visualization uses TiLT input data and graphs the Pitch value of each device that is connected.
* Location - This visualization uses TiLT input data to increase or decrease the size of a circle on a map based on the Pitch value. If GPS is enable on the TiLT device, the circle will also be positioned on the map at that location.
